🏎️ **Next.js 13**: File-based routing, React 18, Fast Refresh, Image Optimization and more.

🔥 **App Router**: Uses React Server Components, Data Cache, and async components.

🟦 **TypeScript**: Strongly typed codebase and GraphQL payloads with strict mode.

🦄 **GraphQL best practices**: Uses GraphQL Codegen and `TypedDocumentString` to reduce boilerplate and bundle size.

🛠️ **Customizable CSS**: TailwindCSS can be extended or replaced with an alternative CSS solution.

👌 **Tooling included**: Comes with ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint Staged, and Codegen preconfigured.

## Quickstart

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To quickly get started with the backend, use a free developer account at [Saleor Cloud](https://cloud.saleor.io/).

Install the latest version of the Saleor CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @saleor/cli@latest
```

[Learn more about Saleor CLI](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/cli).

Set up your local storefront development environment by running the `storefront create` command with `--url` parameter. It will create a clone, install dependencies, and connect with the provided Saleor instance.

```bash
saleor storefront create --url https://{your_cloud_instance}.saleor.cloud
```

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum required version of Saleor CLI is `1.36.0`.

## Payments

Currently, Saleor Storefront supports payments via the [Saleor Adyen App](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/app-store/apps/adyen). To install and configure the payment app go to the "Apps" section in the Saleor Dashboard (App Store is only available in Saleor Cloud).

> [!WARNING]
> To configure the Adyen App, you must have an account with [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> Saleor Stripe App integration is a work in progress.

## Development

Clone and repo and copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SALEOR_API_URL` to your Saleor GraphQL endpoint URL, e.g., `https://example.saleor.cloud/graphql/`.

Then, [install `pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) and run the following command to install all dependencies in the repo:

```bash
pnpm i
```

To start the development server, run the following:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app is now running at `http://localhost:3000`.

> [!NOTE]
> Saleor Storefront is a Next.js app. In case you are not familiar with Next.js, we recommend you to read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) (make sure you've selected "Using App Router" in the sidebar).
