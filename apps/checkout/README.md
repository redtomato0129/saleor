# Saleor Checkout

You most likely don't need this, it's an example React app left for compatibility reasons. We've simplified the deployment of Checkout and **user-facing checkout frontend is now part of `saleor-app-checkout` â€“ see [checkout page inside saleor-app-checkout](../saleor-app-checkout/pages/checkout-spa.tsx).**
